## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amit

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an **IoT-based student transportation management system** for primary and high school students. This system tracks students during their commute and manages their attendance using RFID tags and an ESP32 microcontroller. The data is updated to a database over the internet, without relying on Wi-Fi due to the system's mobile nature.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **network planning and designing** as part of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, specializing in Network Technology & Cybersecurity. My coursework includes network topology, bandwidth distribution, server configuration (including Windows Server 2008 Active Directory), and networking concepts like subnetting, DHCP, DNS, routing, and switching.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **networking concepts** (e.g., subnetting, DHCP, DNS), **IoT solutions**, or **app development** with Flutter. I'm also interested in discussions about building a software companyâ€”I'm considering naming mine 'Zero Inn.'
